# Chatbot
This chatbot carries on a limited conversation in a particular domain using a knowledge base. 
- Saves user models for each user who converses with the bot into a JSON file. The user model stores the user’s name, personal information it gathers from the dialog, and the user’s likes and dislikes of the chatbot. 
- Implements multiple Natural Language Processing techniques including tf-idf, NER, information extraction and parsing. 
- Incorporates a knowledge base from a web crawler. The knowledge base is used to give reasonable responses based on the user's input.
